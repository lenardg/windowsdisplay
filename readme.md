# Window Display project for Raspberry Pi

This projet is a simple lighting project. It runs on a raspberry pi, and is used at our house to light the window of our son. Which then has for example, halloween figurines.

## Requirements

A raspberry pi. I use a Pi Zero W (wireless).
Pimoroni Blinkt! light is used for the lights. 

The Blinkt! python library should be installed beforehand.

## Usage

I just set the crontab to run at every boot one of the scripts. The script have built in timing to run only during designated hours. This might need to be changed depending on where in the world this is run, and at what point of the year.
